== UPGRADE NOTES

Version 0.19.0 adds a new top level `brightbox` command for the suite.

This may clash with our `brightbox` (brightbox-deployment) gem which, before
version 2.4.0, used `brightbox` as the name for it's binary. Please ensure you
update your `brightbox` gem to avoid using the wrong command.

We have included backwards compatible binaries for all the older CLI commands
(brightbox-accounts, brightbox-servers etc...) but recommend getting used to the
new form.

== Installation instructions

Install from Rubygems

    $ gem install brightbox-cli

== Usage

The Brightbox CLI is a suite of tools that are accessible through the
`brightbox` command in a similar way to how you access `git` commands.

For a list of available commands use:

   $ brightbox help

To add client (account based) credentials use:

   $ brightbox config client_add cli-2igtb theclientsecret
   Using config file /home/ubuntu/.brightbox/config
   Creating new api client config cli-2igtb

To browse available resources use the resource name as the command:

   $ brightbox servers
   ... List of servers
   $ brightbox images
   ... List of images

Command structure may be subject to change.

== BASH Autocompletion

A bash autocompletion script is provided to allow autocompletion of
all sub-commands, options and resource identifiers. It is
automatically configured by the Debian/Ubuntu packages, but if you're
installing from a gem you can manually tell bash about it like this:

	complete -C _brightbox-bash-completer -o filenames brightbox

The command `_brightbox-bash-completer` should be installed in the
system path when you install the gem. If for whatever reason it is not
in the path, just specify the full path to it:

	complete -C /full/path/to/bin/_brightbox-bash-completer -o filenames brightbox

== Testing

You should be able to run the specs and features with the following steps:

    $ bundle install
    $ bundle exec rake

The specs use VCR to playback filtered recordings from real API sessions. This
process is not perfect, please report an issue

== Alternatives

There are a number of alternative ways to interact with the Brightbox Cloud.

* The Web GUI - https://manage.brightbox.com/
* fog - https://github.com/fog/fog
* knife plugin - https://github.com/rubiojr/knife-brightbox
* Vagrant plugin - https://github.com/NeilW/vagrant-brightbox

== Packaging

=== Vendoring libraries

gems can be vendored into `lib/brightbox-cli/vendor/` for packaging and will be
prioritised over any gems.

=== Debian/Ubuntu packaging

Packaging scripts are available in https://github.com/NeilW/brightbox-cli-debian-packaging

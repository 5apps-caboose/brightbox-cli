== Packaging

=== Vendoring libraries

gems can be vendored into lib/bbcloud/vendor for packaging and will be
prioritized over any gems.

=== GEM packaging

The gem currently has our branch of fog vendored, as the official fog
gem doesn't have our work merged in yet.

=== Debian/Ubuntu packaging

Any gems that have equivalent packages available are set as
dependencies to the Debian package.  Any other gems are vendored prior
to packaging.  These are:

* formatador (required by hirb)
* excon (required by fog)
* gli
* fog
* hirb
* ini

Rubygems support can be disabled by defining the DISABLE_RUBYGEMS
constant in lib/bbcloud/os_config.rb
